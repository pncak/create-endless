# create-endless
Create: Endless solves a simple problem: You can't get Chorus Fruit without entering The End, and some servers don't allow players to access it.

To solve this problem, recipes for Chorus Flowers and End Stone have been added, using resources from AE2 and Create.

Requires: Create-Fabric, AE2, and CraftTweaker.
